branding-a-global-crowd
=======================

Would love for this to become a real time and always upto date digital legacy on global or local crowd movements such as, Leanstartup machine, StartupWeekend, QuantifiedSelf, #HCSM or local communities such as Appsterdam, that are using globally branded platforms such as meetup.com to create social value. How these movements started, how they grew and engaged dozens, hundreds and sometimes thousands of people across the globe to step up and build local communities with the same goals, while in the process discovering new business models for all involved and building recognizable brands.

#background

There are tremendous changes transpiring in our society, driven by an almost unlimited supply of instant data flows and information. At the same time, in this global economy, governemntal austerity measures are impacting millions upon millions of digital citizens. People are now self organizing and are able to pull from, but also push into the global microexpertise market like never before - to co-create local brands of subject matter experts that span globally. The idea behind this digital legacy is to curate a completely crowd sourced history of these movements and how they will change exogenously the industries they are in, but also our social systems.

#call to action

Well. The main seed is now planted. Help us grow this, create branches for each movement, for each locality but please do not be commercial about it. Facts on revenues streams are cool, interesting and educational. Asking to join a movement or pay dues is not accepted and hopefully will self-correct by other people's edits. I hate to use the google line but "don't be evil"
